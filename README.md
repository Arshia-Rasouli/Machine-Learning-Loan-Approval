# Loan Approval Prediction with Random Forest

This project aims to predict whether a loan will be approved based on customer financial information. The dataset used contains various features such as loan amount, term, interest rate, income, and more. I explore the data, preprocess it, design a pipeline and apply machine learning model to make accurate predictions.

## Steps Involved:
- **Feature selection**: selectig the useful features.
- **Data Cleaning and preprocessing**: Checking missing values and outliers.
- **Building the Pipeline**: Preprocessing and model pipeline
- **Model Training**: Using Random Forest to train the model.
- **Evaluation**: Checking the modelâ€™s performance and testing.

## Model & Evaluation
The **accuracy_score** means the model explains the model **achieved an accuracy of 98%** in Loan approval prediction, showing it works well for the given dataset.
Similarly, the **confusion matrix** supports this by providing detailed insights into the model's performance.

## Key Responsibilities and Achievements
- **Pipeline**: Using  scikit-learn's Pipeline and ColumnTransformer to combine preprocessing and modeling in a clean, reusable workflow.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Gainig hands-on experience with ensemble methods and their benefits for model stability and performance.
- **Random Forest**: Implementing Random Forest as my first ensemble model to improve prediction accuracy.

## About project
This project is part of my machine learning journey, where I focus on ensemble learning and pipeline tasks using the Random Forest.
